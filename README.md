Recently, I explored global COVID-19 deaths and vaccination datasets using SQL, creating meaningful insights from raw data. Through aggregations, joins, and clean transformations, I was able to:
Analyze population impact across continents 🌍
Compare vaccination coverage (total, partial, new) across countries 💉
Prepare datasets ready for dashboards and visual analytics 📊 and much more...
This exercise strengthened my data exploration and SQL skills, while also giving me a hands-on experience in preparing clean, analytics-ready data for real-world problems.
SQL isn’t just about queries—it’s about turning raw numbers into actionable insights!
